#How to configure Focus in local mode

In order to contribute to a focus package, you have to run theses packages locally.

In this document, it is assumed that the application is focus-demo-app.

in the same folder, git clone
* focus-core
* focus-component


for each focus package , launch
* **npm install**
* **npm run build**


In the same folder , get focus-demo-app

* git clone it from the repository
* **npm install**
* launch it in "local" with  **npm run start:local**

# Editing a modification

create a new branch named in the focus package prefixed "fix-" or "feature-"

be careful:

 modify files under the src folder not under focus-core or focus-component folder. These files are generated by babelify

# Testing a modification

  after a modification

  * **npm run babelify** in the modified package - focus-core or focus-component
